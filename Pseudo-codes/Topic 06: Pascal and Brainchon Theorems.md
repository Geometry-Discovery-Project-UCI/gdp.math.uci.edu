# Topic 06 Pascal and Brainchon Theorems

I would like to bring **four** javascripts for animation.

## First One: Desargues Theorem

In the above picture, fixing Point ), fixing Triangle ABC, using mouse to move A', B', C' on the lines OA, OB, OC respectively. Then show that P,Q,R must be collinear.


## Second One: Pascal Theorem

I wish the mourse can be used to move any of the six points A,B,C,D,E,F on the circle. Also, I would like the line XYZ to be a little extended. XYZ 稍微长一点

## Third One: Pappus Theorem

I wish the mouse can be used to move any of the six points A,B,C,D,E,F on the two fixed lines. Also, I would like the line XYZ to be a little extended. XYZ 稍微长一点

<img src="./images/brainchon.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;" class="center"/>

This is a little more difficult. I wish to be able to move the six points but keeping the hexagon tangent to the circle.
