## Setup development environment

If you are using macOS, feel free to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installation.

To setup development environment:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)(Node Package Manager or NPM comes with Node.js).
2. Install pnpm using `npm install -g pnpm`
