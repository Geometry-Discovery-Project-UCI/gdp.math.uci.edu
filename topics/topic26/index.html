        <div> <span style="color: red;font-style: italic" ;> Newton Line</span>, also known as <span
                style="color: red;font-style: italic" ;>Newton-Gauss Line</span>, is the line that connects the
            midpoints of the two diagonals in a convex quadrilateral with at most two parallel sides. </div>
    <li>
        <div> In the following animation, let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral. Let $ABCDEF$ be the corrsponding
            <span style="color: red;font-style: italic" ;>complete quadrilateral </span>with the thre diaognals
            $AC$, $BD$ and $EF$. Then the midpoints of these three
            diagonals are collinear. The red line is the Newton Line of the convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ or the
            complete quadrilateral.
